## 🧠 Overview

In today’s fast-paced digital landscape, organizations face immense challenges in monitoring and maintaining cybersecurity across diverse data sources. This project presents an **AI-powered, real-time dashboard system** that processes natural language prompts to generate dynamic cybersecurity insights tailored to both technical and non-technical users.

Leveraging **SecureGPT**, AWS Lambda, and Plotly visualizations, the system fetches, analyzes, and visualizes security data from logs, alerts, and task datasets, empowering stakeholders with instant, actionable intelligence — **no manual scripting or data wrangling required**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Organizations often struggle to unify and interpret complex security data from diverse sources — such as anomaly logs, network events, and compliance alerts. Static dashboards fall short in delivering real-time, role-specific insights, leading to delayed responses, compliance violations, and increased risk exposure.

This project aims to solve that with:
- A **multi-agent AI system** that interprets user queries.
- **Real-time dashboards** tailored to stakeholder roles.
- **Dynamic visualizations** that eliminate manual effort.

## 🛠 Features

- 🔍 **Natural Language Query Support** (via SecureGPT)
- 📊 **Role-Based Dashboards** (for CISOs, compliance officers, engineers)
- 📈 **Interactive Charts** (line, bar, pie, heatmaps)
- 🧠 **Auto-Summarized Insights** (executive-level summaries)
- 🔐 **Secure Cloud Architecture** (AWS S3, Lambda, API Gateway)
- ⚙️ **Serverless Deployment** for scalable performance

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Backend (AWS Lambda)
1. Create required Lambda functions (`SecureGPT`, `DashboardRenderer`, `SummaryAgent`, etc.)
2. Configure S3 buckets for input and output datasets.
3. Set environment variables and deploy using AWS CLI or Console.

### Frontend (React App)
```bash
cd User\ Interface
npm install
npm start
```
- Open `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the app.

## 📊 How to Use

1. Open the dashboard interface.
2. Enter a **natural language prompt**, e.g., “Show anomaly trends for the last 30 days.”
3. The system:
   - Sends query to SecureGPT
   - Selects datasets
   - Renders charts
   - Generates narrative summary
4. View and download the dashboard.

## 📈 Example Use Case

- **Prompt**: "Summarize this month’s top 3 cybersecurity threats"
- **Output**:
  - Executive Summary
  - Line chart of threat frequency
  - Risk heatmap
  - Compliance status table

## 🧪 Testing & Performance

- 📉 Load tested with **up to 4 million rows**
- ⏱ Avg. dashboard generation time: **<10 seconds**
- ✅ 92% accuracy in chart relevancy
- 📊 Precision: 92.72%, Recall: 84.53%, F1: 88.40%

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 🤖 Voice-based prompt support
- 🔁 Cross-dataset correlation
- 🌐 Mobile app support
- 📢 SMS/Email alerts for high-risk events
- 🧬 3D & AR-based visualizations
